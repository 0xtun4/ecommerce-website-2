The \u0060Application Intent\u0060 keyword is used to specify the intended use of the connection, such as read-only or read-write access. However, it is not a valid keyword for the \u0060SqlConnection\u0060 object and therefore causes an \u0060ArgumentException\u0060 to be thrown.\r\n\r\nTo fix this error, remove the \u0060Application Intent\u0060 keyword from the connection string. If you need to specify the intended use of the connection, you can use other keywords such as \u0060Application Name\u0060 or \u0060Workstation ID\u0060. Additionally, you can check other parts of your code to ensure that they are not using invalid keywords or connection string formats.\r\n\r\nIf you need further assistance, please provide more information about your application, such as the version of .NET Framework you are using and any other relevant code snippets.","Type":0,"Status":1,"FollowUpPrompts":["How can I specify the intended use of the connection?","Can you give an example of a valid connection string?"]},"SelectedFunctionName":"ExplainException","LoggedSkillInvocations":null}
